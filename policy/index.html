<h3 class="h3 box__text">MARKETING</h3>
<p class="box__text">
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:
</p>

<h3 class="h3 box__text">PROMOTIONAL OFFERS FROM US</h3>
<p class="box__text">
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>
<p class="box__text">
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased products or services from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
</p>

<h3 class="h3 box__text">THIRD-PARTY MARKETING</h3>
<p class="box__text">
We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside the TerminusDB group of companies for marketing purposes.</p>

<h3 class="h3 box__text">OPTING OUT</h3>
<p class="box__text">
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by Contacting us at any time.</p>
<p class="box__text">
Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions.</p>

<h3 class="h3 box__text">CHANGE OF PURPOSE </h3>
<p class="box__text">
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please Contact us.</p>
<p class="box__text">
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
<p class="box__text">
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

<p class="box__text">
We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.

<br><br>•       Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
<br><br>•       External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
<br><br>•       Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

<p class="box__text">
We share your personal data within the Data Chemist Group. This may involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
<p class="box__text">
Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p class="box__text">
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

<br><br>•       We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
<br><br>•       Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
<br><br>•       Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
Please Contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>

They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

<p class="box__text">
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p class="box__text">
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p class="box__text">

</p>

<h4 class="h4 box__text">NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</h4>
<p class="box__text">

<h4 class="h4 box__text">WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</h4>
<p class="box__text">
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).

Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience.

You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by Contacting us.</p>

<h4 class="h4 box__text">YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h4>

<p class="box__text">You have the right to:</p>
<p class="box__text">
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p class="box__text">
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<p class="box__text">
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p class="box__text">
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="box__text">
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p class="box__text">
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p class="box__text">
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
