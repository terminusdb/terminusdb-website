<p class="box__text">7.1                Both parties will comply with all applicable requirements of the Data Protection Legislation. This clause 7 is in addition to, and does not relieve, remove or replace, a party's obligations or rights under the Data Protection Acts 1988-2018 and any other European Union legislation relating to personal data and all other legislation and regulatory requirements in force from time to time which apply to a party relating to the use of personal data (including, without limitation, the privacy of electronic communications) and the guidance and codes of practice issued by the relevant data protection or supervisory authority and applicable to a party (Data Protection Legislation).</p>

<p class="box__text">7.2  The parties acknowledge that:

<br><br>(a)            process that personal data only on the documented written instructions provided by you unless required by the laws of any member of the European Union or by the laws of the European Union to process personal data (Applicable Laws). Where we are relying on Applicable Laws as the basis for processing personal data, we shall promptly notify you of this before performing the processing required by the Applicable Laws unless those Applicable Laws prohibit us from so notifying you;
<br><br>(b)           not transfer any personal data outside of the European Economic Area unless the following conditions are fulfilled:

<p class="box__text">11.4             If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Licence, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</p>
<p class="box__text">11.5             Each of the conditions of this Licence operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
